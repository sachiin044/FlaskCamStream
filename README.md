FlaskCamStream is an innovative web application that combines the power of Flask and OpenCV to deliver real-time video streaming from a camera directly to your web browser. This project serves as a practical example of how to integrate live video feeds into web applications, offering a robust solution for various use cases such as surveillance systems, remote monitoring, and live event broadcasting.

The application leverages Flask, a lightweight and versatile web framework, to handle HTTP requests and serve a web interface. OpenCV, a leading computer vision library, is used to capture and process video frames from the camera. Each frame is encoded into JPEG format, which is then streamed to the client in a continuous feed.

Key features of FlaskCamStream include:

Real-Time Streaming: Enjoy a live video feed with minimal latency, ideal for monitoring and surveillance.
Efficient Encoding: Frames are encoded in JPEG format to optimize streaming performance and reduce bandwidth usage.
Simple Integration: Easily integrate camera feeds into your web applications with minimal setup and configuration.
Scalable Solution: Suitable for various applications, from home security systems to live streaming events.
The project is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced developers. The user interface is built to provide a straightforward viewing experience, and the backend is optimized to handle continuous video streaming seamlessly.

Whether you're building a custom surveillance system, a remote monitoring tool, or simply exploring real-time video streaming technology, FlaskCamStream provides a solid foundation and practical implementation. Dive into the code to see how Flask and OpenCV work together to bring live video to the web, and leverage this project to enhance your own applications with live camera feeds.
